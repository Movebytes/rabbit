# Coding standard

Coding standard is very important part of development process for any software.
This document is final version of the coding standard and can't be discussed.

Using the coding standard is important part of development process because of several issues:
- 80% of code will be passed for technical support and optimization process
- It's hard to support and improve code written by different authors which have different coding style
- Good written code is much better to understand to other developers

The coding standard is regarding explicitly to C/C++ programming language but you can use it anywhere.

Each word in name of __function__, __variable__, __name space__ or __user type__ has to starts with uppercase and hasn't got underscore. E.G.: 
```cpp
// Correct 😃
int NumberOfPrimitives;
// Wrong 😔
int numberOfPrimitives;
int number_of_primitives;
```
Macros name has to be in upper case with underscore E.G.: FAST_COS()

Uppercase character is added to the beginning of the user type names for separating the type from the variable name. E.G.:
```cpp
// Correct 😃
RActorComponent VasyaPupkin;
// Wrong 😔
ActorComponent VasyaPupkin;
```
__T__ character is added to the template class name.

The prefix of parent class (character) is added to the child class name.

__I__ (i) is added to the classes which are abstract interfaces. 

__E__ is added to the names of enumerations.

__R__ is added to the names of components.

Boolean variables are started with __b__. E.G.:
```cpp
// Correct 😃
bool bHasFadedIn;
// Wrong 😔
bool HasFadedIn;
```
Pointer names are starded with __p__. E.G.:
```cpp
// Correct 😃
FShaderType* pShaderName;
// Wrong 😔
FShaderType* ShaderName;
```
Pseudonym names which were described with operator __typedef__ are started with __F__. E.G.:
```cpp
// Correct 😃
typedef TAudioComponent FMyAudioComponent;
// Wrong 😔
typedef TAudioComponent MyAudioComponent;
```
Method names of class are verbs which describe what exactly method do or what value returns from method. E.G.:
```cpp
// Correct 😃
bool IsTeaFresh() {...} // Describes the value which is returns
// Wrong 😔
bool CheckTea() {...} // What we have to expect?
```
Method names, variable names and class names have to be clear and correctly describe its meaning. 
More largest name is much more clear. Don't use short names!
Each variable have to declared in a single row. E.G.:
```cpp
// Correct 😃
// Number of persons
int NumOfPersons;
// Maximum value
int MaxValue;
// Wrong 😔
int NumOfPersons, MaxNumber;
```
Each of variables have to be described with comment. 
Each of header files like __.h__  have to be described inside next construction:
```cpp
#ifndef _ME_FILE_NAME_H_
#define _ME_FILE_NAME_H_
.... //
.... // code
.... //
#endif
```
Each of new classes, except of abstract class which has written only in the one __.h__ file, have to be described in the two files: __.h__ and __.cpp__.

You have to write each of the carly brackets (__{}__) in the new line!
```cpp
// Correct 😃
if (bThing)
{
}
// Wrong 😔
if (bThing) {
}
```
Statement of __if__-__else__ have to be formatted next way:
```cpp
if (bThing)
{
}
else if (bThing)
{
}
```
You have to use tabs instead of spaces!
Statement of __switch__ have to be formatted next way:
```cpp
switch (condition)
{
     case 1:
          ...
     case 2:
          ...
          break;
     ...
     default:
          break;
}
```
You have to use __virtual__ and __override__ key words if method can be overrided. E.G.:
```cpp
class A
{
public:
     virtual void F() {}
};
class B: public A
{
public:
      virtual void F() override {}
};
```
You have to use temporary variables for simple understanding of condition. E.G.:
```cpp
// Correct 😃
const bool bIsInPosition = Blah->BlahP->Etc && Stuff;
const bool bIsPlayerDead = bPlayerExists && bGameStarted && bPlayerStillHasPawn && IsFriday();
if (bIsInPosition && !bIsPlayerDead)
{
}
// Wrong 😔
if ((Blah->BlahP->Etc && Suff) && !(bPlayerExists && bGameStarted && bPlayerStillHasPawn && IsFriday()))
{
}
```
Pointers and references have to be formatted next way:
```cpp
// Correct 😃
FShaderType* pType;
// Wrong 😔
FShaderType *pType;
FShaderType * pType;
```
